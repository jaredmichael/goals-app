# Goal Getter

Register to create, update and delete goals you'd like to accomplish.  Create a mantra for each goal to reinforce confidence as you tackle your new goal.  Keep track of all your goals in one place.  Set goals, achieve dreams!  

## Motivation

We believe that anything can be accomplished if a goal is set and it is accompanied with a confident state of mind.  We hope to inspire and help organize goals for everyone to achieve.
